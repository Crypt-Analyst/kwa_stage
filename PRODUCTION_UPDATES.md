def apply_to_bank(request, bank_id):
    """Redirect to bank's loan application page"""
    bank = get_object_or_404(BankProvider, id=bank_id, is_active=True)
    
    # Redirect directly to the bank's loan application page or website
    if hasattr(bank, 'loan_application_url') and bank.loan_application_url:
        return redirect(bank.loan_application_url)
    elif bank.website:
        return redirect(bank.website)
    else:
        # Show bank contact information if no direct link available
        return render(request, 'financial/bank_contact.html', {'bank': bank})
```
